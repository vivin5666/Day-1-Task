Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP1.1:-
=> It works on the textual format.
=> There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
=> It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
=> It compresses data by itself.
=> A text-based protocol uses plain text to encode and transmit data.
=> The client sends a request to a server, and the server sends a response back to the client.
=> A separate connection is established for each request and response, which can add overhead and latency to the communication process.
=> HTTP 1.1 cannot handle buffer overflow vulnerabilities due to the lack of sufficient measures.
=> HTTP 1.1 does not include any in-built features, so the performance it delivers is less efficient.

HTTP2:-
=> It works on the binary protocol.
=> It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
=> It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
=> It uses HPACK for data compression.
=> It works on the binary protocol as a series of binary codes encode and transmit data rather than plain text.
=> A different underlying protocol called Secure Remote Protocol 2 (SRP2) establishes a secure connection between a client and a server
=> It allows multiplexing so multiple requests and responses can be sent over a single connection.
=> HTTP 2 includes measures to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
=> HTTP 2 is designed to be more efficient and performant than HTTP 1.1. This is because HTTP 2 includes several features like multiplexing, binary protocol and header compression.
